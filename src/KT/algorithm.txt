Algorithm for Knight's Tour (work in progress)
----------------------------------------------

1. Choose a random starting point and set it as a current position. Mark it with 1;
2. Determine all accessible (possible and safe) positions;
3. Choose the position P  with minimal count of free accessible positions;
    3.1. If 2 or more positions have the same amount of minimal accessible positions, choose the first position;
4. Mark P as the current position, increment the position counter;
5. Do 2. until a position with no more accessible positions is reached.
